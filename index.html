        <h3>Early years</h3>

        <p class="textd"> Dennis Bergkamp was born in Amsterdan in 1969, his father was an eletrician and amateur
          footballer in the lower leagues. He joined Ajax's youth team at the age of 11. He was clearly one of the
          better players in the academy and made his debut for the senior team in 1986, aged 17, when he was handed his
          professional debut by the legendary Johan Cruyff against Roda JC. </p>
        <p>

        <p class="textd"> He scored his first goal a few months later and finished that season with 23 appearances, a
          Dutch Cup and UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup medal to his name. He was well on his way in his development into one of
          the most exceptional players.

          He won the Eredivisie title in 1990 – Ajax’s first league title in five years – and, by now playing up front
          as opposed to on the wing where he had first broken through, Bergkamp scored 25 goals in 33 league games in
          the 1990-91 season.

        <h3>Arsenal Legend</h3>

        <p class="textd"> Dennis Bergkamp was one of the best players to watch for football fans to watch from the mid
          1990's until the mid 2000's. A scorer of great goals rather than a great goal scorer, it was Dennis Bergkamp's
          brain separated him from everyone else.

          Dennis Bergkamp is probably Arsenal's greatest player ever - ahead of Thierry Henry, ahead of Tony Adams, of
          Ian Wright or Cliff Bastin. It's a big claim to make, but Dennis Bergkamp was something special, a player that
          no one had seen before, or since.

        </p>

        <p>
          He wasn't the most physically gifted, or the fastest - but Dennis Bergkamp possessed a wonderful first touch,
          some outrageous quick thinking and the ability to see everything around him combined with spatial awareness
          that most people could only dream of.
