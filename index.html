        <h3>Early years</h3>

        <p class="textd"> Dennis Bergkamp was born in Amsterdan in 1969, his father was an eletrician and amateur
          footballer in the lower leagues. He joined Ajax's youth team at the age of 11. He was clearly one of the
          better players in the academy and made his debut for the senior team in 1986, aged 17, when he was handed his
          professional debut by the legendary Johan Cruyff against Roda JC. </p>
        <p>

        <p class="textd"> He scored his first goal a few months later and finished that season with 23 appearances, a
          Dutch Cup and UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup medal to his name. He was well on his way in his development into one of
          the most exceptional players.

          He won the Eredivisie title in 1990 – Ajax’s first league title in five years – and, by now playing up front
          as opposed to on the wing where he had first broken through, Bergkamp scored 25 goals in 33 league games in
          the 1990-91 season.

        <h3>Arsenal Legend</h3>

        <p class="textd"> Dennis Bergkamp was one of the best players to watch for football fans to watch from the mid
          1990's until the mid 2000's. A scorer of great goals rather than a great goal scorer, it was Dennis Bergkamp's
          brain separated him from everyone else.

          Dennis Bergkamp is probably Arsenal's greatest player ever - ahead of Thierry Henry, ahead of Tony Adams, of
          Ian Wright or Cliff Bastin. It's a big claim to make, but Dennis Bergkamp was something special, a player that
          no one had seen before, or since.

        </p>

        <p>
          He wasn't the most physically gifted, or the fastest - but Dennis Bergkamp possessed a wonderful first touch,
          some outrageous quick thinking and the ability to see everything around him combined with spatial awareness
          that most people could only dream of.

        <hr class="small-title">
        <p class="p-facts">The Invincibles is the name given to the Arsenal team which won the 2003-04 Premier League. The reason for the nickname is that they went unbeaten in their 38 league matches. They won 26 games and drew 12.
          The Arsenal invincibles will forever be remembered in Premier League history for doing the unthinkable, going a whole season unbeaten. Dennis Bergkamp dropped into the 'No.10' position between midfield and attack,
          being vital part of this amazing squad.

        <p class="p-facts">Arsenal paid tribute to one their best-ever players, immortalizing the great Dennis Bergkamp with this statue outside the Emirates.
          The statue shows Bergkamp in action against Newcastle United in 2003, leaping to control a long ball as it dropped over his head.
          Bergkamp’s statue is the fourth to be unveiled by the Gunners. He joins illustrious company alongside Herbert Chapman, Tony Adams and Thierry Henry.

        <hr class="small-title">
        <p class="p-facts">Bergkamp's nickname is the "Non-Flying Dutchman" due to his fear of flying. In his 2013 autobiography, Bergkamp stated that his phobia was in fact caused by his time at Inter Milan, in which they regularly travelled to away games in small aeroplanes. Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help.
          The condition severely limited his ability to play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. </p>
